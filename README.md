# Package the application
./mvnw package
```

## Running the app
Download the .jar file into the lastest [release]() and run the command explained under this text. 
You can also download the source code and build the code with Maven but make sure to have included all dependencies.

### Launch the teletext server

```sh
java -jar <path-to-jar> server

# Example
java -jar Teletext-v1.0.jar server
```
### Launch a news emiter

# Example
java -jar Teletext-v1.0.jar client
```


## Docker and Docker compose
If you want you can use Docker to run the application. You juste will have to package the jar file by using maven.

git clone https://github.com/truebguillaume/Teletext.git
```

Then go to the project directory and package the app with maven to get the jar file.

```sh
# Download the dependencies
./mvnw dependency:resolve

# Package the application
./mvnw package
```

After that you will be able to build a Docker image.

### Build the image
```sh
docker build -t ghcr.io/<your_github_account>/teletext .
```

### Run the image
```sh
docker run ghcr.io/<your_github_account>/teletext <type> [server, emitter, client]
```

### Publish the Docker image on the ghcr

```sh
# Connect to the ghcr
export GITHUB_CR_PAT=YOUR_TOKEN
echo $GITHUB_CR_PAT | docker login ghcr.io -u <your_github_account> --password-stdin
docker tag teletext ghcr.io/<your_github_account>/teletext
docker push ghcr.io/<your_github_account>/teletext
```

    
There is also a [docke-compose.yaml](/docker-compose.yaml) file. You can compose it up, it will start a server and 4 news emitters.   
After that, you are free to start by yourself the number of client you want by unsing a Docker image or a [.jar]() file.   

In the directory containing the docker-compose.yml use the following command.

### Compose the docker-compose.yaml file up
```sh
docker compose up
```

It will pull the image from the ghcr.


### To shut down the application
```sh
docker compose up
```

You can also use this app by using the project's [Package](https://github.com/users/truebguillaume/packages/container/package/teletext).   
This will allow you to launch an instance of an emitter, a server, or a client.

```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/truebguillaume/teletext:latest
```

### Run the Docker package
```sh
docker run ghcr.io/truebguillaume/teletext:latest <type> [server, emitter, client]
```
if it's an emitter dont forget to add the type of emitter you want. [weather, heig, politic, sport]
