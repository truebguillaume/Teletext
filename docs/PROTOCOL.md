# Protocol d'application TeleText

## 1 - Overview
- The Teletext protocol is designed to enable the transmission, reception, and display of information like a teletext
- The server listens to news emitters and stores the news to allow clients to access and view them.
- The client connects to the teletext server and requests information about different categories (UDP unicast).
- The emitters are independent of the server or clients (UDP multicast).


## 2 - Transport protocol
- The Teletetx protocol uses the `UDP protocol`.
- The server runs on the ports `5000` and `5001`. (`5000` -> listening to the news emitters and `5001` -> listening to the clients)
- The client has to know the IP address of the server to connect to. The client establishes the connection with the server **(unicast)**.
- The emitters send news across the network and the server store them  **(multicast)**.
- The connection between the client and the server stops either when the client enters the command to disconnect or if an error occurs.
- There is no connection between the server and the emitters because that's UDP multicast.
